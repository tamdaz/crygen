# v1.2.2

This version fixes the bug where spacing weren't added between mixins, properties, instance variables, class variables
and nested classes/structs.

The `Crygen::Utils::Indentation` static class has some modifications. Indeed, some method signature have been updated
for better managing the indentation. This change is not a breaking change because this static class is mainly used
for generators, not for the developers.

Finally, the code is refactored to make easier to read.

For a detailed list of changes, see [the milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/tamdaz/crygen/milestone/11?closed=1).
